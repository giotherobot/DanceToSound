# DanceToMusic
A project where I research the possibility to analyze a real time video of a dancer to create music. \n
I use OpenCV to get the video and to analyze it, then the audio output is done with Pyaudio.\n

I found helpful basing the musical part on the article of Davy Wybiral:\n

and his project python-musical: \n
